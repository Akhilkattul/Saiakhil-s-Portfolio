                <h2>Design & Fabrication Drill jig to Drill inclined holes</h2>
                The project titled "Design and Fabrication of Drill Jig to Drill Inclined Holes" was undertaken as a part of the final year engineering curriculum. The primary objective of this project was to enhance productivity and maintain part accuracy in mass production by developing a specialized tool—a drill jig—that enables precise drilling of inclined holes with minimal manual intervention. <br><br>
                <b>Objective:</b><br>
                In mass production, achieving high productivity and maintaining part accuracy are critical. This project aimed to design a drill jig that can
                <ol>
                    <li>Facilitate the drilling of inclined holes with high precision.</li>
                    <li>Reduce manual intervention in the drilling process.</li>
                    <li>Improve the location accuracy of the part being drilled.</li>
                    <li>Enhance overall efficiency in the production process.</li>
                </ol>
